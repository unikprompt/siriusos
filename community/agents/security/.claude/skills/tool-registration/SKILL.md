# Tool Registration

When a new tool, CLI binary, or bus script becomes available, it must be documented in TOOLS.md so all agents know it exists.

---

## Where TOOLS.md Lives

Each agent has its own TOOLS.md in its workspace directory. All 3 templates ship with a full TOOLS.md — it is the canonical tool reference for that agent.

```
orgs/{org}/agents/{agent}/TOOLS.md
```

---

## What to Add

Every entry in TOOLS.md needs:
- **Binary/command name**
- **What it's for** (one sentence)
- **Usage pattern**
- **Key flags** (if any)
- **Example calls**

---

## Adding a New Bus Script

Bus scripts live in `$CTX_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/bus/` and are invoked as `cortextos bus <command>`.

When a new wrapper is added, add an entry in the `## Bus Scripts` section of TOOLS.md:

```markdown
### new-command
Brief description of what it does.

```bash
cortextos bus new-command <required_arg> [--optional flag]
```

- **required_arg**: What it is
- **--optional**: What it does

Example:
```bash
cortextos bus new-command "my value" --flag result
```
```

Also add it to the Quick Reference table at the bottom of TOOLS.md:
```markdown
| I need to...         | Command              |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| Do the new thing     | `new-command`        |
```

---

## Adding a New Third-Party CLI

Add a dedicated section at the bottom of TOOLS.md under the `## Third-Party Tools` heading:

```markdown
### ToolName (purpose)
- **Binary**: `toolname`
- **Use for**: What tasks it handles
- **Auth**: How to authenticate
- **Usage examples**:
  - `toolname command --flag value`
  - `toolname other-command`
- **Important**: Any gotchas or constraints
```

---

## After Updating TOOLS.md

1. Notify the orchestrator so it can update its own TOOLS.md if the tool is org-wide:
```bash
cortextos bus send-message "$CTX_ORCHESTRATOR_AGENT" normal "New tool registered in TOOLS.md: <tool name>. Update your TOOLS.md if applicable."
```

2. If it is a shared tool all agents should have, the orchestrator should broadcast to all agents.
