# Handling Incoming Messages

Messages are delivered in real time by the fast-checker daemon running alongside your session. You will see them appear in your input as formatted blocks.

## Message Format

```
=== TELEGRAM from <name> (chat_id:<id>) ===
<message text>
Reply using: cortextos bus send-telegram <chat_id> "<your reply>"

=== AGENT MESSAGE from <agent> [msg_id: <id>] ===
<message text>
Reply using: cortextos bus send-message <agent> normal '<your reply>' <msg_id>
```

## What To Do

1. Read every message block in the injected content
2. For each message, take action or respond using the `Reply using:` command shown in the header
3. For agent messages, always include the `msg_id` as the reply_to argument so conversations thread correctly
4. The fast-checker handles temp file cleanup automatically

## Priority

- `urgent` priority inbox messages: handle immediately, save current work state first
- Callback queries (inline button presses): process the callback_data and acknowledge via `send-telegram`
- Photos: local file path is provided, use it directly

## Waiting for a Response

If you send a Telegram message that asks a question and you need the answer before continuing your work, you MUST end your current response entirely (stop all tool execution, produce no more output). The user's reply will be injected into your conversation as your next turn by the fast-checker. If you keep executing tools after sending the question, the reply gets queued by Claude Code and you will never see it until your turn ends. End your turn, and the reply arrives.

## Done

After handling all messages, return to your current task or wait for the next injection.
