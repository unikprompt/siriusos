# Memory

You have three memory layers. All are mandatory. Without memory, session crashes and context compactions leave the next session starting blind.

The purpose of daily memory is not to log activity — it is to capture enough context that you (or a fresh session) can resume intelligently without re-reading everything.

**Each entry should answer: "if my context was wiped right now, what would I need to know to resume intelligently?"**

---

## Layer 1: Daily Memory (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md)

Session-scoped context journal. Written at key checkpoints, not continuously.

**Location:** `memory/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).md` in your agent workspace

### On session start
```bash
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
mkdir -p memory
cat >> "memory/$TODAY.md" << MEMEOF

## Session Start - $(date -u +%H:%M:%S UTC)
- Status: online
- Crons active: <list from CronList>
- Inbox: <N messages or "empty">
- Current state: <where things stand — what is in progress, pending, or needs attention>
- Resuming: <what to do next and why, with enough context to act without re-reading everything>
MEMEOF
```

### Mid-work inline note (write immediately when something important happens)
```bash
echo "NOTE $(date -u +%H:%M UTC): <key decision / discovery / user preference / non-obvious thing>" >> "memory/$TODAY.md"
```
Don't wait for the heartbeat. Use for: significant decisions, user preferences learned, non-obvious situations, anything you would want the next session to know. One line.

### On heartbeat
```bash
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
cat >> "memory/$TODAY.md" << MEMEOF

## Heartbeat - $(date -u +%H:%M:%S UTC)
- Current focus: <what I am working on and why>
- Active threads: <anything in progress or being monitored — state of each>
- Key decisions: <decisions made since last entry with brief rationale>
- Context notes: <anything non-obvious — user preferences, environment state, blockers>
- Next: <what I am doing next>
MEMEOF
```

### On session end (before any restart)
```bash
TODAY=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)
cat >> "memory/$TODAY.md" << MEMEOF

## Session End - $(date -u +%H:%M:%S UTC)
- Status: [done/interrupted/context-full]
- Current state: [where things stand — specific enough that the next session can resume cold]
- Active threads: [anything in progress or mid-task with current state]
- Key decisions: [significant decisions from this session worth carrying forward]
- For next session: [what to do first and what context is needed]
MEMEOF
```

### Reading today's memory (on resume)
```bash
cat "memory/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).md" 2>/dev/null || echo "No memory for today yet"
```

---

## Layer 2: Long-Term Memory (MEMORY.md)

Persistent learnings that survive across all sessions. Not a log — a living document.

**Location:** `MEMORY.md` in your agent workspace

### When to update
- Patterns that work or don't work
- User preferences discovered
- System behaviors noted
- Important decisions and their reasons
- Corrections you received — things you did wrong
- Anything you'd want to know on the next fresh session

### Format
```markdown
## [Topic] — YYYY-MM-DD
<what you learned>
```

Update at every heartbeat and session end. Ingest to KB after updating.

---

## Layer 3: Knowledge Base (RAG/ChromaDB)

Re-ingest MEMORY.md and today's daily memory on every heartbeat so they stay semantically searchable:
```bash
siriusos bus kb-ingest ./MEMORY.md ./memory/$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d).md \
  --org $CTX_ORG --agent $CTX_AGENT_NAME --scope private --collection memory-$CTX_AGENT_NAME --force
```

---

## Target

- Session start, every heartbeat, session end — minimum 3 entries
- Each entry captures context state, not just activity
- Update MEMORY.md at least once per week with durable learnings
